# palindrome-checker
Thank you for visiting my repository. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a palindrome app. It enables users to determine whether a word or collection of words can be written backwards and still be the same as the original word (s). It can also look for numerals that are a palindrome, such as the date 22/02/2022. It also removes non-alphanumeric characters. To make it work, I use the following JavaScript concepts: getElementById(), click event, array methods, conditional expression, tenary operator, and so on.
